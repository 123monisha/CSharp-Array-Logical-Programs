## âœ… Programs Included

1. **Find Maximum and Minimum in Array**
   - Finds the largest and smallest element in an array.
   - Demonstrates the use of loops and conditional statements.

2. **Reverse an Array**
   - Reverses the elements of an array in-place.
   - Shows understanding of array indexing and swapping.

3. **Remove Duplicates from Array**
   - Removes repeated elements from an array without using built-in collections (optional version uses HashSet).
   - Demonstrates logic for checking duplicates and array traversal.

4. **Rotate Array (Left Rotation)**
   - Rotates array elements to the left by one position.
   - Useful for understanding array manipulation and shifting elements.

5. **Find Missing Number in Array**
   - Finds the missing number in a sequence of numbers using sum formula or built-in `Max()` method.
   - Teaches mathematical logic combined with array traversal.
